This is a fine tuned version of the yolov5 model trained on additional images of dogs from the open image dataset. The goal is to perform live inference on a video feed from a webcam to locate whether or not my dog currently is in the living room. In the long term I'm planning to build an auto encoder for anomaly detection so that I can receive push notifications if Roxy is doing something unusual.
